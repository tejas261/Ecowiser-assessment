Ecowiser Assessment for Frontend Developer Internship

Task: Build a notekeeper application ( think Google Keep ) with the following  features: 
1. Add a note with a title, tagline and body. The note is visible in a grid layout on the  page and clicking on one will open up editable content in a pop-up on the screen. 2. Notes can be pinned such that regardless of date of origin or last edit, pinned  notes are always at the top. 
3. Pagination must be implemented. One page can contain at max 6 notes, no  more. 
4. You can use any basic managed service for your CRUD. Google Cloud will  probably be best. 
5. No sign in is required. Multiple people can add notes. 

All of the requirements are fulfilled to the best of my knowledge

Steps to run

2. Enter npm run dev in the terminal.
3. The project is up and running at the displayed localhost address
